##
This MATLAB/Simulink project simulates a wiper system for a vehicle. The simulation models the behavior of the windshield wiper mechanism under varying rainfall conditions. The system incorporates sensors to detect rainfall intensity and controls the wiper speed accordingly.

Main Simulink Model:

Wiper_System_Model.slx: This Simulink model contains the entire wiper system simulation, including sensor models, control logic, and wiper mechanism.
Subsystem Models:

Rainfall_Sensor_Model.slx: Simulink model representing the rainfall sensor behavior.
Wiper_Control_Model.slx: Simulink model for controlling the wiper speed based on rainfall intensity.
Wiper_Mechanism_Model.slx: Simulink model of the windshield wiper mechanism.
Scripts:
